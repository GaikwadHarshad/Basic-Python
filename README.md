# Data visualization in python

    1. What does it take to make visualization in Python?
		Not much ! Python has already made it easy for you â€“ with two exclusive libraries for visualization, commonly known as 			matplotlib and 	seaborn. Heard of them?

	I. matplotlib:
		Python based plotting library offers matplotlib with a complete 2D support along with limited 3D graphic support. It is 		useful in producing publication quality figures in interactive environment across platforms. It can also be used for 			animations as well. To know more about this library, check this link.

	II.Seaborn: 
		Seaborn is a library for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics in python. This library is based 			on matplotlib. Seaborn offers various features such as built in themes, color palettes, functions and tools to visualize 			univariate, bivariate, linear regression, matrices of data, statistical time series etc which lets us to build complex 			visualizations. To know more about this library, check this link. 
	2. What are the different visualizations we can make?

		There are five key plots that you need to know well for basic data visualization. They are:

		I.Line Plot
		II.Bar Chart
		III.Histogram Plot
		IV.Box and Whisker Plot
		V.Scatter Plot
